# model_choice.txt
# This file is for making model choices for a single run of McFACTS
# It is your start up file!
#
# SMBH mass in units of M_sun:
#
mass_smbh = 1.e8
#
# Choices about the SMBH accretion disk:
# 
# If user has a disk model, it must specify the disk surface density
#   as a function of radius in a file called name_surface_density.txt
#   where the surface density is in units of kg/m^2 and the radius is in
#   units of gravitational radii (R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2).
#   McFACTS assumes the innermost specified radius in the disk surface density
#   input file is the inner edge of the disk, and the outermost specified 
#   radius is the outer edge.
#   User must also supply the disk aspect ratio as a function of radius
#   in a file called name_aspect_ratio.txt
#   Both files must have surface density & aspect ratio specified at the
#       SAME set of radii.
#   Here name = disk_model_name
#
#   McFACTS comes with the following example options for disk models:
#       flat: constant surface density & aspect ratio (unphysical)
#       sirko_goodman: from Sirko & Goodman 2003
#       thompson_etal: from Thompson, Quataert & Murray 2005
#
#   If the disk has a migration trap, its radius must be specified below
#       to prevent overshooting in coarse grained models. If there is no
#       trap, set trap_radius = 0. (all BH will eventually accrete onto SMBH)
#
# Specify prefix to filenames for input disk model
disk_model_name = 'sirko_goodman'
# trap radius
trap_radius = 700.
#
#
# Choices about Nuclear Star Cluster Population:
#
# Initial conditions assume a Pareto initial mass function (user specifies
#   peak mass and power law index), a Gaussian initial spin distribution, 
#   the spin torque condition to align with the AGN disk, & mass accretion 
#   rate of fully embedded stellar mass black holes in terms of the Eddington
#   ratio.
#
# number of BH in disk to start
n_bh = 200
# Mode of initial BH mass distribution in M_sun (peak of Pareto fn)
mode_mbh_init = 10.
# Pareto (powerlaw) initial BH mass index
mbh_powerlaw_index = 2.
# Maximum initial BH mass in distribution in M_sun
max_initial_bh_mass = 40.
# Mean of Gaussian initial spin distribution (zero is good)
mu_spin_distribution = 0.
# Sigma of Gaussian initial spin distribution (small is good)
sigma_spin_distribution = 0.1
# Spin torque condition: fraction of initial mass required to be accreted
#   before BH spin is torqued fully into alignment with the AGN disk. 
#   We don't know for sure but Bogdanovic et al. says between
#   0.01=1% and 0.1=10% is what is required.
spin_torque_condition = 0.1
# Accretion rate of fully embedded stellar mass black hole in units of 
#   Eddington accretion rate. 1.0=embedded BH accreting at Eddington.
#   (1 is perfectly reasonable fiducial!)
frac_Eddington_ratio = 1.0
#
# Choices about Nuclear Star Cluster initial orbits:
#
# Maximum initial eccentricity (upper bound to initial uniform distribution)
#   this is ecc around SMBH of single orbiter
#   want to eventually turn this into some physically motivated thing
#   for now assuming uniform distribution [0.0 .. max_initial_eccentricity]
max_initial_eccentricity = 0.3
#
# Choices about timing:
#
# McFACTS evolves populations once per timestep according to chosen physics
#   Choose a timestep that allows some things to happen, but not everything
#   to happen in one timestep. Migration timescale across your disk is a
#   good fiducial: 10kyr=1.e4 is a reasonable choice in a Sirko & Goodman
#   disk with a lot of 10Msun BH. Timestep is in units of years. Disk 
#   lifetime is set by choosing your number of timesteps:
#   lifetime = timestep * number_of_timesteps
# 
# timestep in years
timestep = 1.e4
# For timestep=1.e4, number_of_timesteps=100 gives us 1Myr disk lifetime
number_of_timesteps = 6
#
# Choices about binary formation
#
# Switch to inhibit retrograde binaries.
# This allows the user to test the (q,X_eff) anti-correlation, which requires prohibiting retrograde binary_bh_array
# retro = 0 turns all retrograde BBH at formation into prograde BBH. retro = 1 keeps retrograde BBH once they form
retro = 0
