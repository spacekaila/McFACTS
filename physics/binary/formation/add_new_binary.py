    """This is where we add new binaries. We take the locations, masses, spins, spin angles and generations
    from the relevant singletons, found in hillsphere.binary_check, and sort those parameters into bin_array. 
    We then ADD additional parameters relevant only for binaries, including semi-major axis of the binary,
    semi-major axis of the orbit of the center of mass of the binary around the SMBH, a flag to permit or 
    suppress retrograde binaries, eventually eccentricity and inclination. There is also a verbose flag 
    that is by default set to False, to suppress overly detailed output.

    bindex : int
        counter for length of bin_array before adding new binaries
    retro : int
        switch to inhibit retrograde binaries.
        retro = 0 turns all retrograde BBH at formation into prograde BBH. 
        retro = 1 keeps retrograde BBH once they form. Eventually will turn this into
        something physically motivated rather than a brute force switch.
        default : 0
    verbose : bool, optional
        how much output do you want? set True for debugging, by default False
